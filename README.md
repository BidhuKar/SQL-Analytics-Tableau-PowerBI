In the above project, I have evaluated the HR department dataset about absenteeism and health. 
I used SQL analytical to provide a data-driven approach to determine how to provide a bonus and incentive to healthy employees. 
For this, I have developed a MySQL database, and SQL queries to answer questions, and build a dashboard that meets a wireframe specification.  
This is an end-to-end project using Data Analysis, SQL, and Visualization suing Power BI and Tableau.
